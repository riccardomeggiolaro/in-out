    Gets a list of reservations with optional filtering for incomplete reservations
    and additional filters on any reservation field or related entities.
    
    Args:
        only_uncomplete (bool): If True, only returns reservations with missing or insufficient weighings.
        filters (dict): Dictionary of filters (column_name: value) for search. Can include nested attributes.
        limit (int): Maximum number of rows to return.
        offset (int): Number of rows to skip.
        fromDate (str or datetime): Start date to filter by date_created. Default is None.
        toDate (str or datetime): End date to filter by date_created. Default is None.
        order_by (tuple): Tuple containing (column_name, direction) for ordering.
            Direction can be 'asc' or 'desc'. Default is (date_created, desc).

        tuple: A tuple containing:
